For this script to work correctly, the following conditions must be in place:
1. The Messari and Encode tables must be opened in Chrome                           // (for shortcuts to work)
2. The Messari tab must be to the left of the Encode tab                            // (so the order of copying and pasting is correct)
3. Hide all fields in the Messari tab apart from: date, amount, investors, stages   // (So the order of copying is correct)
4. Filter the Messari records so only the ones to be copied are in view             // (not exactly necessary but helps avoid mistakes)
5. In the Encode table, the input view must be active                               // (so data is pasted in the right place)
6. Before you start the script, ensure the correct starting cells are selected:
    - Messari tab - topleft-most cell selected
    - Encode tab - left-most cell of the line the data will be added from
7. When the script is activated with the enter key, go to the Messari tab and wait

//Top tips:
  + The script will automatically add new records into the Encode table
  + Do not touch your keyboard or mouse/trackpad when the script begins
